# algo-practice

Some of the practice problems I've done while preparing for interviews.
These are problems that I wanted to keep track of because they were interesting or had a particular problem solving approach I want to be able to refer back to in the future.
They may be from Udemy courses, Leetcode, AlgoExpert, CTCI, Pramp, etc.
If the problem is from Leetcode or AlgoExpert and was accepted on that site, this repo may not contain any tests.
